Christ our Lord invites to

who earnestly repent of their sin
and seek to live in peace
with one another.
[NEWSLIDE]
Therefore, let us confess our sin
before God and one another.

**Merciful God,
we confess that we have not loved
you with our whole heart.**
[NEWSLIDE]
**We have failed to be
an obedient church.**
[NEWSLIDE]
**We have not done your will,
we have broken your law,
we have rebelled
against your love,**
[NEWSLIDE]
**we have not loved our neighbors,
and we have not heard
the cry of the needy.**
[NEWSLIDE]
**Forgive us, we pray.
Free us for joyful obedience,
through Jesus Christ our lord.
Amen.**
[NEWSLIDE]
Hear the good news:
Christ died for us
while we were yet sinners;
that proves God's love towards us.
[NEWSLIDE]
In the name of Jesus Christ,
your are forgiven!
[NEWSLIDE]
**In the name of Jesus Christ,
you are forgiven!

Glory to God. Amen.**

**It is right to give our
thanks and praise.**
