Our Father,
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
[NEWSLIDE]
Thy kingdom come;
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
[NEWSLIDE]
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.
[NEWSLIDE]
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power,
and the glory, forever.
[NEWSLIDE]
Amen!
